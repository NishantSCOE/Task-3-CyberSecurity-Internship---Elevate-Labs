# Task 3: Vulnerability Scanning with Nmap

This repository contains my report for Task 3 of the Elevate Labs Cybersecurity Internship. The objective was to perform a vulnerability scan on a local computer to identify security weaknesses.

## 🛠️ Tool Used
I used the **Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)** for a fast and efficient scan. This approach allowed for a quick assessment without the lengthy setup of other tools, while still effectively testing for numerous known vulnerabilities.

## 🔬 Key Finding
The primary finding of this assessment was that **no active vulnerabilities were discovered** on the target system. The Nmap scripts confirmed the machine was not vulnerable to several checks and returned inconclusive results on others. This indicates a positive security posture for the tested machine.
